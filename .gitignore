# Data (Optional: usually good to ignore raw data if large, but user might want to keep it if small. 
# Recommender systems usually ignore 'data/' and 'artifacts/' but for a showcase repo usually we exclude raw data but keep artifacts if small.
# I'll exclude large raw data zip if present, but user didn't ask to exclude data.)
